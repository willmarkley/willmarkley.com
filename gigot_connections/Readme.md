# Gigot Connections

*Language: Google Apps Script (JavaScript based)*

Gigot Connections is a tool that helped connect alumni and students in the 2015-2106 McCloskey Business Plan Competition. I developed a searchable spreadsheet with a graphical user interface. This spreadsheet held the data of over 135 interested students that could be filtered by major, skills, and a variety of other useful fields. This database was accumulated by distributing a Google Forms for students to fill out. The code that powered the functionality of the searchable database was written in Google Apps Script, a JavaScript based language. Finally, some very basic HTML code was written to serve as a landing page for the tool.
