		<p class="description">Constructed entirely in C++, this game features three action packed levels of Notre-Dame-Athletics-themed survival.  The objective of the game is to shoot various athletic equipment at Notre Dame rivals.  The main player has a health gauge that lowers after colliding with an enemy.  Additionally, each level features a question-mark box that contains either a positive or negative effect on the player.  For detailed instructions on how to play the game, please see the repository <a class="code-link" href="https://github.com/willmarkley/FinalProject/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">README</a>.  Finally, the <a class="code-link" href="https://www.libsdl.org" target="_blank">SDL library</a> was used to rendered the graphics.</p>
